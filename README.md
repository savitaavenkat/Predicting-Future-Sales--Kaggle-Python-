Motivation:
-----------
Predicting sales performance is one of the key challenges every business faces. It is important for firms to
predict customer demands to offer the right product at the right time and at the right place. The motive behind
this challenge is to predict future sales (sales for the upcoming month) for every shop and item pair, given 3
years’ historical sales data ranging between years, 2013 to 2015 (including). This historical data has been
generously provided by a Russian software firm named, 1-C company [1] . However, the dataset has sales
figures depicting per shop per item per day, in contrast, to the ask of the challenge (to predict monthly sales).
The highlight of the dataset presented is that the list of shops and items vary every month (i.e.) the shops
and items present in the dataset aren’t bound to have sales every single month. Adding on, the item name,
item categories, etc., are in Russian- making it harder to interpret at first glance. All these cumulatively add
up to the complexity of the challenge.

We intend to build a model that would provide an accurate a priori prediction about total sales for any given
product and store that sells it, on the basis of historical time-series sales data, using machine learning
algorithms. The below sections details each and every stage implemented as part of our machine learning
pipeline.
